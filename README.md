This is a simple app to help users register their complaints, view and track them
and the admin can view the complaints and update the status.

Technology used for back-end:
i have used firebase real-time database for storing data of users and complaints, firebase storage to store images,
firebase authentication for login.

I will be adding notification,profile image for users and material design soon.
